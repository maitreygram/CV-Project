# CV-Project

## Video Logs (Update as you watch video)
**1.** 0:46 => Extracting each frame from the video using CV2 library. Then just to display the image (each frame of the video), made a class "Display". This class contains a function "paint" that actually displays the image. Then just called this function for each frame of the video.

**2.** 0.46:1.05 => Extraction of features. Then starts to metch feature points.
